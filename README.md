## Projects üöÄ

Here are some of the exciting projects I‚Äôve worked on:

1. **Time-to-sell Prediction with Audi**  
   - Collaborated in a team of four to develop a deep learning model predicting the time it takes to sell cars.
   - Achieved a margin of error of just 9 days with interpretable results using a Generalized Additive Model (GAM).

2. **[Fake News Classification](https://github.com/jn-stw/ML_fakenews_detection)**  
   - A project focused on classifying news as fake or true using both classical machine learning and modern deep learning approaches.
   - Achieved highly reliable results with extensive data preprocessing and feature engineering.
